The analysis explores the human and economic impact of severe weather, focusing on several key research questions:

* **Harm & Impact Analysis**: Identifying which states, counties, and event types cause the most human harm (injuries/deaths) and assessing the economic damage from floods.

* **Trend & Correlation**: Analyzing historical trends in storm magnitude, mapping tornado frequency by state, and exploring the correlation between storm types and location.

* **Predictive Modeling**: Using a Random Forest model to determine the strongest predictors of human harm, including feature-engineering population density to weigh human vs. meteorological factors.
